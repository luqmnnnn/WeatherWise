WeatherWise: Your Personal Weather Companion 🌦️
Hey there! 👋 WeatherWise is a desktop app I built to solve my own frustration with checking multiple weather apps before hiking trips. It combines real-time weather data with activity planning - all in one simple interface.

Why I Built This
You know that feeling when you're packing for a camping trip and suddenly wonder: "Will it rain? Should I bring an extra jacket?" I got tired of juggling between weather apps and my notes, so I created WeatherWise to put everything in one place.

What It Does
✔ Live weather updates - See current conditions and forecasts at a glance
✔ Plan outdoor activities - Store all your hike/camp/trip details
✔ Smart packing lists - Never forget your gear again
✔ Works offline - Because nature often means no signal

Features You'll Love
Weather at a Glance
See everything you need in one dashboard - temperature, wind, humidity, and precipitation chances. The app highlights when conditions might affect your planned activities.

Activity Planner
I added this after forgetting my hiking poles on three separate trips. Now you can:

Create activities with dates/locations

Get weather-based suggestions ("Might rain - pack a waterproof jacket")

Track preparation progress

Packing Lists That Make Sense
The app suggests gear based on:

Activity type (hiking vs camping)

Weather conditions

Duration of your trip

You can customize everything and save templates for future use.
